    <h1>VolumeControl_HandGesture</h1>
    <p>This is a project that uses hand gestures to control the volume of your computer. The code uses computer vision to detect hand gestures and translate them into volume control commands.</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, along with the following libraries:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>OpenCV</li>
      <li>NumPy</li>
      <li>PyAutoGUI</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can install these libraries using pip:</p>
    <pre>pip install opencv-python numpy pyautogui</pre>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To run the project, simply clone the repository and run the <code>main.py</code> file:</p>
    <pre>git clone https://github.com/NileshRajput1/VolumeControl_HandGesture.git
cd VolumeControl_HandGesture
python main.py</pre>
    <p>Once the program is running, you can control the volume by making hand gestures in front of your computer's camera. The following gestures are supported:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Closed fist: mute/unmute</li>
      <li>Open hand: unmute</li>
      <li>One finger up: increase volume</li>
      <li>Two fingers up: decrease volume</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exit the program, simply press the <code>q</code> key.</p>
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>This project is currently limited to controlling the volume of your computer using hand gestures. It does not currently support other types of controls or gestures.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the accuracy of the gesture recognition may be affected by lighting conditions, camera quality, and other factors.</p>
